after proxying the connection of jenkins
the link ll be tcp://"docker inspect the container and get the ip add":port
the port should be the same as the one in the command (2375)


if we run python script on jenkins default agent it won't run
so i created an image and pushed it to my docker hub 
and i used it as a jenkins agent
